GPGame: Solving Complex Game problems using Gaussian processes

This R package provides tools for finding game equilibria in a black-box setting (expensive pay-off evaluations, no derivatives).
Two game setups are considered: Nash games and Kalai-Smorodinski games.
Handles noiseless or noisy evaluations. Graphical outputs can be generated automatically.
